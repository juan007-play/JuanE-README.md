<h1>üë®üèΩ‚ÄçüíªJuan Gonz√°lez </h1>

I am a versatile full-stack web developer proficient in technologies such as JavaScript, React, Flask, and Python, acquired through an intensive bootcamp. Throughout my training, I engaged in projects that honed my technical abilities and enhanced my capability to collaborate effectively within teams.

I am dedicated to continuous learning, proactive in my methodology, and committed to ongoing self-improvement. I take pleasure in building web applications across both the frontend and backend, and I quickly adapt to new challenges, significantly contributing to the projects I participate in.

Presently, I am focused on advancing my professional development as a developer, tackling challenges that allow me to refine my skills and add value to impactful projects.
